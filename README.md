# Log-Warden: Self-Healing DevOps Agent

Log-Warden is a DevOps automation system that analyzes system logs, predicts incident severity, estimates time-to-failure, and generates remediation scripts using a Large Language Model (LLM).

The system integrates **Machine Learning**, **LLM-based remediation**, **REST APIs**, and **Docker containerization** to demonstrate a practical automated incident-response pipeline.

---

# Key Features

* Automated log analysis
* Severity classification using Machine Learning
* Time-to-failure prediction
* LLM-generated remediation scripts
* REST API built with Flask
* Containerized deployment using Docker
* Unit tests with pytest

# Machine Learning Pipeline
## Model Selection and Generalization

This project uses two machine learning models:

### Logistic Regression – High Severity Classification
The task of predicting whether a log entry represents a high severity event is a binary classification problem. Logistic Regression is well suited for this task because it efficiently models the probability of binary outcomes and performs well with high-dimensional sparse features such as TF-IDF vectors derived from log text.

### RandomForestRegressor – Time to Failure Prediction
Time to failure prediction is a regression problem. Although Linear Regression was initially considered, log patterns often contain non-linear relationships between features and system failures. RandomForestRegressor was chosen because it captures non-linear relationships and interactions between log features through an ensemble of decision trees, leading to more robust predictions.

### Ensuring Generalization
To ensure the models generalize well to unseen log data:

- The dataset was split using an **80/20 train-test split**
- **Cross-validation** was used to evaluate model stability
- **TF-IDF vectorization** was used to transform log text into meaningful numerical features
- Logistic Regression uses **L2 regularization**, helping reduce overfitting
The ML pipeline performs two main tasks:

### Severity Classification

Predicts whether a log indicates a critical incident.

Model used:

```text
LogisticRegression
```

Output:

```text
high_severity = 0 or 1
```

---

### Time-to-Failure Prediction

Estimates how soon a system failure may occur.

Model used:

```text
RandomForestRegressor
```

Output:

```text
time_to_failure_minutes
```

---

### Log Preprocessing

Logs are cleaned using:

* timestamp removal
* IP address removal
* punctuation filtering
* stopword removal
* lemmatization using spaCy

---

# LLM Remediation Agent

If a log is classified as **high severity**, the system triggers an LLM agent.

LLM used:

```text
Groq llama-3.1-8b-instant
```

The agent generates a **safe Python remediation script**.

Safety constraints include:

* system state validation
* logging usage
* no destructive operations

Forbidden commands include:

```text
kill -9
rm -rf
fsck -f
systemctl restart
```
